Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

Every time I was able to call a function multiple times it gave me a 
really good visual of how powerful functions are. Especially when it
comes to time saving.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

Test functions are super useful when I would normally need to type
something out to test something over and over again. It was also 
really nice when I was testing them for things that involved more
difficult math.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

When I had troubles with a problem, I usually start by trying to find a
program from the examples or something similar I'd already written to
use as a stencil. Then I'd google it so I get a more general answer. 
Then I'd ask an AI what was wrong and ask it to explain why what I had
done was wrong.
